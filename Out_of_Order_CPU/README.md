# Structure
This project is about simulation of an out_of_order execution CPU, the logic of the CPU is defined in `OoO_cpu.py` (this file uses an existing file in GEM5 project).

Options are set in `opts.py`.

You can execute the command line instruction, or you can edit auto.sh which is a script allows automatic execution and records the result in `results.txt`

The pdf is a report after analyzing the result of 48 times simulation.
