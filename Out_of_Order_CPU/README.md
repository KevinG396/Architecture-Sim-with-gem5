This project is about simulation of an out_of_order execution CPU, the logic of the CPU is defined in `OoO_cpu.py` (this file uses an existing file in GEM5 project).
\nOptions are set in `opts.py`.
\nYou can execute the command line instruction, or you can edit auto.sh which is a script allows automatic execution and records the result in `results.txt`
